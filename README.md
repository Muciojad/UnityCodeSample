## Code Samples

Attached samples come from my current engineering project I'm working on. This code is not perfect, but I'm still learning - often doing mistakes and realizing it month later, when codebase has grown and something is not as scalable as should be.

Samples are from different parts of project - there are samples from game mechanics(traps/minigames, event triggering), user interface (parts of UI system code, screen view component code) and from game systems (game objectives - logic and data).
